# Staff-Directory

Design and write a complete user friendly menu driven C program to serve as Staff Information System for a company. The program saves all records to a database file (i.e. database.dat). If the database file cannot be read, an error message will be printed to notify the user.

The program allows the user to add, delete the staff profile according to the user’s option. In addition, the program exports all staff profiles to an output text file (i.e. “output.txt”)

This program was an assignment during my bachelor degree :)
