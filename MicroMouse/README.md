# MicroMouse
Autonomous Robot Mouse

Micromouse is one of the most interesting and challenging among all existing robotic
games. It began to draw great attention from university students all around the late
70s. In this robotic game, the robot mice will be placed in a random maze at the
starting position. The robot mice have to work autonomously and able to find their
way from starting position to a predetermined position. Once the mice have found the
way to the designated position, they have to return to the starting position in the
shortest time possible.
